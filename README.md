# odin-recipes

This is a HTML project used to test basic skills in HTML knowledge. I will be creating a Project called 'Recipes', which is a 
webpage that includes names of my favourite recipes and relative links to webpages for each recipe.

By the end of this project, I will have affirmed my basic knowledge and skills in utilizing HTML to create webpages, and to clone and push my project to GitHub.
